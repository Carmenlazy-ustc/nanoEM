# COMSOL implementation a general nanoscale electromagnetic framwork described in arxiv: 1901.03988.

This fully retarded electrodynamic framework is comprehensive for electromagnetic problems with length scales >= 1 nm. It incoporates dominant nonclassical effects---nonlocality, spill-in/out, and surface-enabled Landau damping---using surface response functions known as the Felbelman's d-parameters.
