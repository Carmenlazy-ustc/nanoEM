# COMSOL implementation a general nanoscale electromagnetic framework



# Key Features

Compatible with the built-in COMSOL solvers and modules.

Genearally applicable in 1d, 2d, 3d, and cylindrical coordinates.

A full-retarded electrodynamic framework featured by surface response functions known as the Felbelman's d-parameters. 

Incoporation of dominant nonclassical effects---nonlocality, spill-in/out, and surface-enabled Landau damping---for length scales >= 1 nm.
