# COMSOL implementation of a general framework for nanoscale electromagnetism



# Key Features

Compatible with the built-in COMSOL solvers and modules.

Genearally applicable in 1d, 2d, 3d, and cylindrical coordinates.

A fully-retarded electrodynamic framework using surface response functions known as the Felbelman's _d_ parameters. 

Incoporation of dominant nonclassical effects (nonlocality, spill-in/out, and surface-enabled Landau damping) for length scales ≥1 nm.

# Examples

Plane-wave scattering solutions provided for cylinders, bowtie antennas, spheres, and film-coupled nanodisks. 

Can be generalized to other electromagnetic problems such as eigenmode problems, spontaneous emission, near-field scanning microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and more.
